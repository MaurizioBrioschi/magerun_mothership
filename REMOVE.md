How to remove
=============

Remove the following directories

* 

```
```


Method 1 - the easiest one
--------------------------
This method needs you to have a home folder where all the custom modules will be located.

* Execute the following snippet

```
mkdir -p ~/.n98-magerun/modules/
```

* Clone the repository or symlink it. I prefer the symlink way as all my repositories are checked out in one place but this is up to you. The following example will clone the directory directly.

```
cd ~/.n98-magerun/modules/
git clone https://github.com/mothership-gmbh/magerun_mothership.git
```
