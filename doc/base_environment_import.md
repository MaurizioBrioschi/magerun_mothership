Import the configuration settings by overwriting the existing configurations. There is one example file ```settings.example.php```.
Just copy the file as ```settings.php``` and customize the settings for your needs.

 * File Structure

 You need to have some files in the directory ```Mothership\Environment\resource```. They should be named like ```environment_anyname```.
 If there is more then one file, name it like your environments. Please define one file as a fallback.
